# Language Detection using Classical NLP

This project is a simple language detection system built using classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It identifies the language of a given text input based on a trained machine learning model.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- CountVectorizer (Bag-of-Words model)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
- Train-Test Split (70-30)
- Scikit-learn (for modeling and evaluation)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains sentences in multiple languages along with their language labels. Each row represents a sentence and its corresponding language.
